# scripts/fleet-vocabulary.sh — the Makefile verb x repo register, plus the test floor (#691)
# ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# DOES EVERY REPO SPEAK THE SAME `make`? Nine repos had nine dialects: "dry run" was spelled
# two ways, "verify core" five, "check packages" two, and only `help` was common to every
# Makefile in the fleet. A contributor moving between repos re-learned the verbs each time,
# and no gate noticed — the surface a contributor actually touches was a convention, and
# it was failing measurably.
#
# scripts/make-vocabulary.txt declares the canonical verbs ONCE, in Core. This script reads
# each sibling repo's Makefile and reports, per verb, whether the canonical target exists.
# Aliases are the repo's business: keeping `bootstrap-dry` as a `.PHONY` alias of `dry-run`
# costs two lines and is not this register's concern. THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT THE CANONICAL
# NAME EXISTS. A verb that genuinely does not apply is declared, not silently absent, in the
# repo's .github/core-gates.txt — the same file the gate x repo register reads:
#
#     make:<verb> none <why this repo has nothing to run here>
#
# THE TEST FLOOR rides in the last column. Five of nine repos had no repo-owned tests at
# all — including dotfiles-Fedora, the template every Linux repo is stamped from. The floor
# is deliberately low: a `test/` (or `tests/`) directory with something in it, and a
# workflow under .github/ that runs it. Not Windows' 85% coverage bar, which is
# disproportionate for a thin OS shim; just "a suite exists and CI runs it", which is what
# a template should meet before it is copied eight more times. There is no waiver line for
# the floor: a floor with a bypass is a suggestion.
#
# DERIVED, NOT HAND-MAINTAINED, for the reason fleet-coverage.sh gives: every cell is read
# from the repo at run time, so a target renamed away from the canonical spelling shows up
# on the next run instead of in the next contributor's confusion.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/fleet-vocabulary.sh              # markdown table on stdout
#   ./scripts/fleet-vocabulary.sh --check      # exit 1 if any verb is missing/undeclared
#                                              #   or any repo is under the test floor
# Env: REPOS_ROOT (default: parent of this repo)
